# React Fitness Backend ReadMe

Ever wondered if you're getting enough protein in a day? Or carbs? Or if that workout you did was even worth it? If you've ever felt like your wellness routine is a guessing game, you're not alone. The truth is, it's almost impossible to know without a little help.

Enter React Fitness — your co-pilot in the quest for a healthier you. It's not just a tracker; it's a tool that helps you uncover the hidden patterns in your daily nutrition and exercise. Because living a healthier life shouldn't be a mystery, it should be an adventure.

This Rails backend API works in conjunction with React Fitness Frontend, the repo for which can be found at: https://github.com/ahotchkin/react-fitness-frontend

The frontend provides the user with a dashboard view of their daily nutrition and fitness, while the backend API contains a database with information for users as well as a comprehensive food database to use across the application.
