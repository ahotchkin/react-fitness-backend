# React Fitness Backend ReadMe

Have you ever wondered if you're eating enough protein during the day? Or carbohydrates? Or fat (yes, we need fat!)? Or maybe you're not sure how many calories you should be consuming on any given day? Or if you're getting enough exercise? If you found yourself answering "Yes!" to any/all of the above, then React Fitness is just the thing for you. Providing a platform to track daily nutrition and exercise, React Fitness is a tool for users to learn more about their patterns and habits, and what they can do to live a healthier life.

This Rails backend API works in conjunction with React Fitness Frontend, the repo for which can be found at: https://github.com/ahotchkin/react-fitness-frontend

The frontend provides the user with a dashboard view of their daily nutrition and fitness, while the backend API contains a database with information for users as well as a comprehensive food database use across the application.
